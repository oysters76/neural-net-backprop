# Backprop visualizer 

A project inspired by going over the CNN lectures by Standford university.
Uses HTML Canvas and vanilla JS to stimulate and visualize backprop and forward prop of a simple function as a computational graph. 

Goals are to extend this to mimic gradient descent and also to visualize any trivial mathermatical function to demostrate forward and backward prop. 

Currently the development is at its inital stages.
